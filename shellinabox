on iPad OS, safari or chrome use desktop ua to visit, not mobile way
----------------------
in chroot env

apt install shellinabox

openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout example.key -out example.csr -subj "/C=GB/ST=L
ondon/L=London/O=Acme Widgets/OU=IT Department/CN=192.168.0.1"
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in example.csr -signkey example.key -out example.crt
cp example.key server.key
cp example.crt server.crt

cat server.crt server.key > certificate.pem
shellinaboxd -p port

then visit ip with cert https://192.168.0.1:4200

make sure that visit ip is that same ip in the cert

---------------------------------------
if you want to use ssh instead of login

/etc/init.d/ssh start # start sshd in debian chroot env
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config # get the ssh port for example 22

shellinaboxd -p 4200 -s /:SSH:1.0.2.2:22

then visit https://localhost:4200 will re-direct to 1.0.2.2:22
you may set on localhost and visit localhost will re-direct to 1.0.2.2
you can use it in a chroot env then re-direct to host ssh port, 
so you can visit host

use SSH instead of LOGIN can solved session timeout issue
otherwise you may need to set timeout in pam for LOGIN
--------------------
you can also point the cert path, for example cp certificate.pem to ssl
shellinaboxd -c ssl

--cert will find certificate on $PWD which is . by default
-t will not enable ssl
-s :LOGIN or :SSH
-u user
-p port 4200 is default

if you just want run it on local then
shellinaboxd -t -s :LOGIN -u root
visit https://localhost:4200
