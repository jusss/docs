telegram-cli, nctelegram based on pytg and telegram-cli
but telegram-cli doesn't provide proxy,
so use redsocks + iptables redirect the connection to ssh tunnel

1. install redsocks
yay -S redsocks

2. edit the config
sudo vim /etc/redsocks.conf
let's assume ssh socks proxy tunnel listen on localhost:1080,
so change that redsocks.conf to connect to 1080

3. edit the iptables
sudo vim /etc/iptables/redsocks.rules
redirect tcp connection to redsocks

4. run redsocks
cd /etc; sudo redsocks

5. run iptables
sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/redsocks.rules
sudo iptables -t nat -F # to clear it
