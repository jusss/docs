sound with pulseaudio
I found the default archlinux have no sound even alsamix show its intel soundcard
because it uses pulseaudio not alsa
pacman -S pavucontrol
then in "Output Devices" tag click the icon of mute audio, it will work

also make your use is belong audio group
or gpasswd -a john audio
