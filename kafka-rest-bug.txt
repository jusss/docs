kafka-rest, when you do subscription, "no content in response" , so I didn't read the response,
then when I use GET to get messages, error 500 show up,
but if I read the response, which is null, then I can get messages for server, it's weird!

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json" --data '{"topics":["jsontest"]}' \

# No content in response

httpurlconnection and okhttp is same, kind of low level
