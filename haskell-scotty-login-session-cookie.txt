session and cookie
    
get "/test" $ do
         agent <- header "User-Agent"
         liftIO $ print agent
         setSimpleCookie "this-is-cookie-name" "b" -- or setHeader "Cookie" "a=b"
         text "hi"

there's is request and response
client with 'get' request, server give an response

header "User-Agent" could let server get client's browser info from client's request
setSimpleCookie "this-is-cookie-name" "b" would let server give client a response header, with Set-Cookie, then client will save this cookie and use it in header to do the next request

so we can set SessionId=6 in the cookie, by server give a response with Set-Header

with that SessionId in the cookie, client do the next request with the cookie
server will recognize who the client is and let it pass

and also server could use response header to send a delete cookie to client,
then client browser would delete it


`addSession conf' would send client browser a header session id
Session {sessionSid = "23d2ed156291952634b1c644343eb5c431f97a5eb77168965269ec0cbe4d78e2b8f182de66a6c95ab346f0d7de6e612cf244065ede8c7fb8cf8ef7cf91c4e4fce958bee71f57707ed3ef443e1cdc865394273fe3e783e35b5ce6f8f11bd9ecfef54a1dead8a7478d63e579cf1218318dd1d9c31a2d5ea2ca5e40", sessionExpiration = 2022-01-30 09:34:18.209000774 UTC}


setHeader "Set-Cookie" cookie

server use setHeader "Set-Cookie" response to client browser,
then client will save the cookie, which contain SessionId, use it for the rest request
then server use Header "Cookie" to get the browser's cookie, and check the SessionId
if it's expired, then sent Delete-Cookie as response header, browser take that then delete cookie

in chromium F12, network could check the header info
