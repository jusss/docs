after disconnect when power off, power on, hold fn + 2 for 4 seconds,
then run systemctl restart bluetooth; blueman-applet; blueman-manager to connect


keychron k3 has a bluetooth 5.1, good connections to 4.0 devices

it use fn + 1/2/3 to switch different bluetooth devices, not fn + f1,

fn + S + O hold for 4 seconds, will disable auto sleep mode

keychron k3, function keys not working on archlinux,
'cause linux think it's hid_apple, even it switch on Win/Android, not Mac/iOS on keyboard

solution

sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf
options hid_apple fnmode=2

sudo rmmod hid_apple
sudo modprobe hid_apple

now press F5, check if its behavior like F5, it not then
press fn + X + L and hold for 4 seconds, then press F5
or try fn + K + C for 4 seconds, it will work

0 = disabled : Disable the 'fn' key. Pressing 'fn'+'F8' will behave like you only press 'F8'

1 = fkeyslast : Function keys are used as last key. Pressing 'F8' key will act as a special key. Pressing 'fn'+'F8' will behave like a F8.

2 = fkeysfirst : Function keys are used as first key. Pressing 'F8' key will behave like a F8. Pressing 'fn'+'F8' will act as special key (play/pause).
