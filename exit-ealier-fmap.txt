ealier exit in map
map (+1) [1,2,3,5,7] 
how to let it once meet 3 then exit whole computation?
callCC ? ContT r [] a?
without map, recursion function can do that
in other languages's iteration, break and return can do that

but not all the languages support TCO except haskell and scheme

and kotlin doesn't too

 fun foo() {
        val t = run loop@{
            listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).forEach {
                if (it == 1) return@loop 1 // non-local return from the lambda passed to run
                if (it == 3) return@loop 3 // non-local return from the lambda passed to run
            }
        }
        println(t)

    }
    foo()
