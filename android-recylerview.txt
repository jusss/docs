adapter class match and bind item view which inside recyclerview
then bind adapter class with recyclerview
use wrap_content in inside recylerview
change recylerviewAdapter-onBindViewHolder item attributes
same as ListViewAdapter - getView

in listview's adapter class's getview function, bind recyclerview and recyclerview's adapter

recyclerview inside listview
because listview doesn't have horizontal oritation
but recyclerview has grid layout

1. recylerview_item.xml
2. RecyclerviewAdapter.kt bind recylerview_item.xml
3. listview_item.xml create recylerview
4. in ListviewAdapter.kt - Adapter class - getView function
bind ListviewAapter to listview_item.xml
bind RecyclerviewAdapter to recylerview
5. in activity, create listview, bind ListviewAdapter to listview

if you want recylerview inside recyclerview
in parent recylerview Adapter - onBindViewHolder
bind child recylerview Adapter to recylerview inside parent layout
