data Maybe a = Jut a | Nothing
this is a sum type

data F = F Bool Int, this is a product type

in OOP, use subclasses to implement product and sum type

<jusss> dminuoso: I still have no idea about ADT and what it's used for
<dminuoso> jusss: An ADT is just the simple idea that you can create data
           types with a) multiple constructors and/or b) multiple fields in a
           given constructor. Nothing more.
<dminuoso> THat's it. :)
<dminuoso> jusss: Having "multiple constructors" is sometimes called "a sum
           type" and having "multiple fields in a constructor" is sometimes
           called a "product type". There's really nothing more to it. :)
                                                                        [17:16]
<merijn> Well, there's a lot more to it, but all that is mostly unnecessary
         for programming :p                                             [17:17]
<jusss> ok                                                              [17:18]
<dminuoso> jusss: In school you most likely learned elementary algebra in
           which you can add numbers... multiply numbers... so in the same
           sense the name "algebraic data types" is just derived from the fact
           that you can "add and multiply types together"               [17:19]
<dminuoso> jusss: (In truth there's more to it like merijn' hinted at, but
           this is sufficient for Haskell)                              [17:21]
