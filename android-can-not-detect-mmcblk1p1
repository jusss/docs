there's no /dev/block/mmcblk1p1 only /dev/block/mmcblk1

fdisk /dev/block/mmcblk1

the number of cylinders for this disk is set to 32000
there is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024
and could in certain setups cause problems with 
1) software that runs at boot time
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs

try fsck.ext2 -t root /dev/block/mmcblk1

fdisk -l /dev/block/mmcblk1

first cylinder to 1 when fdisk /dev/block/mmcblk1, or under 2048


or mkfs and fdisk on android, use busybox

on Android
