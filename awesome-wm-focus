it is possible set awesome wm focus to "do not force focus by new window?" .. 

 { rule = { instance = "gmail something or other" },
      properties = { floating = true, focus = false }  },

thnx .. and how to set it to "all" new upcoming windows?

At the beginning of your rules, there should be a rule that begins "{ rule = { },". It applies to all windows so simply add "focus = false" to the list.


$ mkdir -p ~/.config/awesome/
$ cp /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua ~/.config/awesome/
