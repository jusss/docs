systemd service files store 
/usr/lib/systemd/user/    where units provided by installed packages belong
~/.config/systemd/user/   where the user puts its own units
/etc/systemd/user/        where system-wide user units are placed by the system admin
/lib/systemd/system/
/etc/systemd/system/
~/.local/share/systemd/user/  where units of packages that have been installed in the home directory belong

systemctl --user enable x.service

systemctl --user link ./home-john-mnt.mount doesn't work!
because it needs to be absolutely path!
systemctl link /home/john/home-john-mnt.mount works!
systemctl start home-john-mnt.mount
systemctl enable home-john-mnt.mount
