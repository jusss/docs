there're Primary and Clipboard on linux,
and select by cursor just copy them to Primary, not clipboard
and vim doesn't come with +clipboard attribute from the most distro
so install gvim and uninstall vim
gvim will enable this on Xorg environment by default
or you can use :set guioptions+=a
or you can compile vim with +clipboard option or use xclip
