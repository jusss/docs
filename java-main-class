it's about src folder, src folder should be blue in idea, mark as `source root`
then create a package 'com.sun.k2p' and create a new file Robot.kt under it,
there's a class Robot in Robot.kt, and the main class is com.sun.k2p.RobotKt
if there's a package 'com', and pacakge 'sun' in package 'com', and package 'k2p' in 
package 'sun' and file Robot.kt in package 'sun', it's the same main class
this is used to describe several pacakges like com.sun.k2p or com.microsoft.k2p
or com.google.k2p

if there's main.kt in src, then its main class is MainKt without any prefix name


java's class instance must be in a method of a class!
you can instance a class in a class directly, do it in a method of a class!

kotlin, src/k2p.kt   there's a class Robot in it, and no main function,
and its main class is K2pKt
if it's main.kt, its main class should be MainKt

src if it's not blue, 'cause it's not source root, right click change it to source root

src/ right click create package, com.sun.k2p
right click create a new file Robot.kt on that package,
pacakge com.sun.k2p will auto show in that new file
main class will be com.sun.k2p.RobotKt
so in kotlin, main class is "pacakge-name.file-name"

export to jar
Project Structure - Artifacts - '+' - JAR - from modules with dependices
main class is com.sun.k2p.RobotKt
Build Artifacts - build 

import jar
create lib folder in project, and copy jar to that folder,
Project Structure - Modules - Dependencies - + - JARs or directories choose that jar in lib
