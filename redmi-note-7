reference https://wiki.lineageos.org/gapps.html 

enable adb in Development mode 
choose usb preferences to `File Transfer` not `No data transfer`

then `adb shell` check if it works,
copy all pictures and videos to /sdcard/backup
adb pull /sdcard/backup/ ./AndroidMedia/
adb push MindTheGapps-11.0.0-arm-20210412_124103.zip /sdcard/ 
adb push lineage-18.1-20210525-nightly-lavender-signed.zip /sdcard/

in Development mode enable 'advanced reboot', then reboot into recovery
then get into twrp,"Wipe" swip to factory reset, not "Format", because it formats your ROM
flash lineageos then flash gapps, flash them at the same time, then reboot system,

REMEMBER! put sim card out of redmi note 7, use redmi2 create a wifi spot cross gfw 
then redmi note 7 connect it
-------------------------------------------------------------
gapps and lineageos need to be flash at the same time, otherwise wipe lineageos data and cache in recovery then flash gapps
use TWRP recovery to flash gapps, lineageos has signature auth,
download TWRP from https://twrp.me/ 
twrp-3.5.1_9-0-lavender.img

download gapps from https://opengapps.org/
open_gapps-arm64-10.0-nano-20210406.zip

download lineageos from https://download.lineageos.org/lavender 
lineage-17.1-20210330-nightly-lavender-signed.zip

use magisk for root privilege manager

make sure you enabled Development mode first, enabled adb 
download twrp.img, then goto into Windows 10, sometimes fastboot flash recovery has some errors on linux
find the Android Studio's adb.exe, in C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\
set it to Path envrionment,
plug your phone to PC, choose `file trans`, run `adb shell`, if it works,
then copy lineageos ROM and gapps to internal storage, 
poweroff your phone, then Power with Volumn down key to fastboot mode,
run `fastboot devices` to check if it's detected,
if so, then `fastboot flash recovery twrp-3.5.1_9-0-lavender.img`, `fastboot reboot`,
press Power with Volumn up key to get into twrp recovery mode,
this would prevent the official recovery get back

if it doesn't work, pop up some errors like "invalid parameter" or "too many links"
just try another PC, and with USB 2.0, not USB 3.0,
also, install miflash20191206 for the drivers 

after you installed twrp then reboot your phone,
then get into twrp,"Wipe" swip to factory reset, not "Format", because it formats your ROM
flash lineageos then flash gapps, flash them at the same time,
if you only flash lineageos then get into it, then you need wipe cache then flash gapps
now reboot system, if it stucks in lineageos logo, then get into twrp,
"Wipe" -> "Format" -> input yes, format whole user data including your ROM,
then reboot system, it will get into lineageos!

REMEMBER! put sim card out of redmi note 7, use redmi2 create a wifi spot cross gfw 
then redmi note 7 connect it

everytime, flash recovery, make sure `adb shell` is working and `fastboot devices` detected the device
press seven times enable developer mode, enable adb, then connect it to PC, choose `trans files` usb option,
then `adb shell` to check if it works

Global India EU and China four rom versions
there're two official roms, recovery and fastboot version,
recovery version is download from the official website,
fastboot version is used with miflash.exe in fastboot mode,

in miui 10, click the logo icon ten times, it will enable "choose update package"
update with local recovery version rom, but global recovery version rom can't install by this

it is using fastboot version rom, flash with miflash.exe

and there's another option, fuck miui, just download lineageos's recovery.img
then flash it in bootloader, then install lineageos rom
or flash TWRP Recovery to flash any rom
