in hotspot tethering, so this phone can be a route for other devices,
and they don't need VPN to visit google

if you want to make PC use android's VPN, but don't use mobile data
1, disable mobile data then connect phone to router with wifi
2, connect phone to PC with usb cable
3, enable usb-tethering and allow clients to use VPNs

or you can use mobile data, and by usb-tethering or hostspot to share VPN to other devices

if you want share with hostspot, you must use mobile data
if you want share with usb-tethering, you can use mobile data or wifi
if you want share vpn over wifi, you must use usb-tethering

android's camera as a plug-in camera of a laptop

download IP Webcam by Pavel Khlebovich from Google Play,
turn laptop and android wifi and data off, then connect laptop
and android with usb cable, enable android usb-tethering for that
laptop can get an IP from android, once laptop get an IP from android
via dhcp, now run IP Webcam on android, click the last option "enable server",
android will open camera and show an IP address you need to connect with browser,
once you get there, click "browser" tag not "flash" in "Video" section on that website
and click "fullscreen" it will pop up a new website, click the video and it will expand,
then press F11 to fullscreen, and also you can plug an external monitor via hdmi/vga,
you can make what android's camera captured to show in the external monitor at the
same time.

same usage to Xserver XSDL, 

use usb cable to form an ethernet between android devices and PC,
it's really fast to do something like passing files, ssh -XY, etc

but I wonder how to form an ethernet between Windows 10 and Linux with
A single usb cable?
also there is a reverse tethering, so android could use PC's network,
