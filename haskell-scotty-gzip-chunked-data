1. browser itselft provide extract gzip package function, but without compress gzip package function
2. so the server can provide Content-Encoding: gzip, Transfer-Encoding: chunked to download, but the client can't use that to upload, unless use js in the website


upload file with chunked data, the server need to provide a post interface which received the chunked data,
and in the html, js implement slice the big file and post chunked data to that web interface, Transfer-Encoding: chunked,
Content-Length is the data size
also you can use python requests to post chunked data directly to that web interface

browser doesn't provide post chunked data, js provide it
but browser support download chunked data to one file
search Transfer-Encoding on mdn
