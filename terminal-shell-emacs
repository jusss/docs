emacs上不光有eshell or shell这种shell, 还有ansi-term or term这种terminal emulator,
xterm也是一种terminal emulator, 当然也有physical terminal

<bremner> that's why I just said but these damn kids and their ipods  [14:30]
<michaelrose> I said like a terminal + elisp
<jlf> you're still wrong

<jlf> you may as well claim that a piece of paper is a terminal emulator
<bremner> no u  [14:32]
<tali713> michaelrose: terminal in your sentence is short for "terminal
	  emulator".  eshell is not a "terminal emulator" it is a "shell
	  written in elisp"
<jlf> yo may as well claim that a piece of paper is a terminal emlator
<bremner> well played sirrah
<michaelrose> a piece of paper is a lot less like a terminal than eshell is
* lemonpie mumbles something about teletypes
* jlf doffs hat
<bremner> if you can't run vim in it, it's not a terminal  [14:33]
* bremner glares at lemonpie
<tali713> lemonpie: indeed, but a typewriter is a teletype emulator, that only
	  runs cat.
<lemonpie> i've run vim on a teletype, and regretted it a few seconds later
								        [14:34]
<tali713> lemonpie: I've said it before, I'll say it again, ed is the standard
	  editor for a reason.
<lemonpie> (it just dumps you into ex, as any 'too dumb' terminal will if you
	   run vim again)
<lemonpie> well, vim's shitty emulation of ex
<michaelrose> the original user wanted to know if emacs could provide a
	      similar interface to a terminal, an interface in which you can
	      interact with your system via a shell whereby you can enter a
	      command and see the results  [14:35]
<jusss> so what's terminal and termianl emulator? difference
<michaelrose> I answered the question he was asking as if he had phrased it
	      better
*** tgips (~user@unaffiliated/tgips) has quit: Ping timeout: 246 seconds
								        [14:36]
<tali713> jusss: the first is how people who get tired of saying terminal
	  emulator all the time say terminal emulator.
*** davidh (~user@x4e34cb2e.dyn.telefonica.de) has quit: Remote host closed
    the connection
<tali713> jusss: a terminal emulator is a program that emulates a physical
	  terminal.  for example a VT100
<jusss> eshell is a shell not terminal, and xterm is a terminal emulator?
								        [14:38]
<tali713> so this is a Terminal
	  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CvHI105WcAA51K3.jpg
<tali713> jusss: a terminal is a screen with a keyboard attached that talks to
	  a host.  it's almost never what a person means when they say
	  "terminal", at least not in this century.  [14:39]
*** davidh (~user@78.52.203.46) has joined channel #emacs  [14:40]
<lemonpie> a lifetime ago i used to have a wyse 30 in my bedroom so i could
	   irc from bed :/
<jlf> this century is overrated
<tali713> jusss: so yes, xterm is a terminal emulator, since it emulates
	  having an addressable screen and supports control codes that a
	  physical terminal would.  it also supports more than any physical
	  terminal I am aware of.  [14:41]
*** smerdyakow (~user1@172.98.154.12) has quit: Quit: Leaving  [14:42]
<tali713> jusss: similarly both M-x term and M-x ansi-term are terminal
	  emulators, though not nearly as featureful as xterm.  almost
	  anything can be a dumb terminal.  as long as it can send characters
	  and receive them.  not a particularly interesting case to consider.
	  unless you are looking for a teletype emulator.
<lemonpie> the last of the DEC terminals were true beautys that would give
	   xterm a run for it's money  [14:43]

<jusss> tali713: what's the connection between shell and terminal emulator?
<tali713> jusss: a shell is a type of program that can run in a terminal.
								        [14:45]
<jlf> jusss: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator  [14:46]
<lemonpie> ouch, VT525s are expensive on ebay :(
<jlf> jusss: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)
<tali713> but it may only need dumb terminal support, or it may be a program
	  that runs outside of a terminal.  but typically they run in
	  terminals and typically have some support for video terminal
	  features.
