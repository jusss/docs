android could use miracast to cast screen to windows through wifi
but google remove miracast, so does AOSP, so lineage OS too
google use chromecast now

and windows 10 use miracast as default, if your android ROM can do miracast,
then it can cast screen on windows, if it's lineage OS , then no 

there's another way, use scrcpy, through adb show android screen on windows,
and even you can operate it

on Android 11, lineageos 18.1
enable use debugging, wireless debugging, choose pair device with pairing code

on Windows
adb pair android-ip:port
input pair code
scrcpy 

below Android 11, lineageos 17.1
on android
enable wireless debugging

on windows
adb tcpip 5555
adb connect android-ip:5555
scrcpy --window-borderless -f -Sw



also there're some android phones could do video output to monitor directly,
like Samsung phone with dex, OnePlus phone
