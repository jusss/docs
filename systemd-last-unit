<jusss> how to know tha last init unit in systemd?
<sheep> jusss: there's no reliable way, but you could check journalctl -t
	systemd

<jusss> sheep: why they don't give them a number like system v init?  [15:49]
<sheep> jusss: because it's parallelized
<sheep> and there's stuff like timer units where the services may or may not
	be started during init
