two states, one eval, one not eval,
list eval return list
funtione eval return value

list and function are Funtion in not eval state
think function like list in not eval state 
f x, is a structure, just like [x]
so in not eval state, [ (g x) ]
so f (g x)

fmap g [x] = [ (g x) ]
fmap g (f x) = f (g x)
but f x would be evaluated by eval stratege
so fmap g f = \x -> f (g x)

WRONG!
