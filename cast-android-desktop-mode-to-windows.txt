Redmi Note 7 Lineage OS 18.1 Android 11
Cube i6 Air Windows 10 32bit
scrcpy win32 v1.17

1. use otg connect android to windows tablet
2. developer options, enable Force Desktop mode, Force activies to be resizable, Enable freeform windows and Enable freeform siecompat
3. there're two ways to set second display's resolution
        one is use developer options's Simulate secondary displays
        another is `adb shell settings put global overlay_display_devices 2048x1536/300` , change 2048x1536/300 to `none`  to close it
4. right click on scrcpy.exe -> Properties -> Compatibility -> Change high DPI settings ->
    Override high DPI scaling behavior -> Scaling performed by Application
    this will solve fuzzy fonts and blur icons show on windows 10, this should improve VNC image quality
5. on windows 10, run `scrcpy.exe --display 1 --window-borderless -f -Sw`, if display 1 is not available, it may be 2 or 3, check the error message

'cause connected by usb type-c cable, so no need for adb over wifi, just run scrcpy will be ok
before that, remember run `adb shell` to check if it's connected, if not, then choose MTP as usb connection option
if you want use adb over wifi, then run `adb pair android-ip:port` input pair code, then run `scrcpy`
make sure you enable adb wireless debugging first
2048x1536 is tablet's resolution, change it to your screen's resolution, and 300 is density, like scale, if fonts and icons too big or small, change it

windows 32bit, scrcpy can't use --render-driver opengl, it cause a blank screen, as default it uses direct3d
