function with static types is very like class’s method in a way
data constructor is very like class constructor

data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int, gender :: String }
class Person (name: String, age: Int, gender: String) { … }

that constructor is class name

getUserName :: Person -> String
getUserName (Person name age gender) = name

it’s very like class’s method
class Person (name: String, age: Int, gender: String) {
 function getUserName(self){
    return self.name
  }
}
