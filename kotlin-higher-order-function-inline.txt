inline fun inlined(block: () -> Unit) {
	println("before")
	block()
	println("after")
}

inlined { println("do something here") }

inline fun inlined won't create a function, only when inlined is called, then to expand it

in order to reduce the memory overhead of such higher-order functions or lambda expressions

it just replaces inline function call with its definition
