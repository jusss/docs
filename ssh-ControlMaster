~/.ssh/config
Host *
ControlPersist yes
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath ~/.ssh/master-%r@%h:%p

# this will generate a socket file in ~/.ssh/master-user@remote:port

then run "ssh -p 22 -N root@moon"
now ssh again will be very fast
and vim scp://root@moon:22/a.hs will be very fast

if there're file exist, disable multiple, just delete .ssh/ssh-socket-file
may set ControlPersist 2h will good
