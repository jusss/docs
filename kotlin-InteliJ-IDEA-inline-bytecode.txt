InteliJ IDEA, it keeps showing
Cannot inline bytecode built with JVM target 1.8 into bytecode that is being built with JVM target 1.6
under Either.applicative()

turn out, in build.gradle, package 'wu.seal.jsontokotlin:library:3.6.1' cause this, not arrow-kt

delete     implementation 'wu.seal.jsontokotlin:library:3.6.1'
and add

configure([compileKotlin, compileTestKotlin]) {
    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = "1.8"
    }
}
