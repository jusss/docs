0, it needs root privilege, so magisk or supersu to granted your app
0.5, it needs "package names viewer" to get apk's name
0.7, it needs adb shell getevent to get button's position where you want to click

1. open an app, adb shell; getevent
2. click that buttons in app; now get message from adb
3. find 0035 and 0036 lines, get the followed hex number
4. change hex number to decimal, then `input tap x y` that number 

tried to get button's position with view.getX or event.getX, not luck

ws.setOnTouchListener(object : View.OnTouchListener {
            override fun onTouch(v: View?, event: MotionEvent?): Boolean {
                when (event?.action) {
                    MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN -> {
                        val x = event.getX().toString()
                        val y = event.getY().toString()
                        val vx = ws.left.toString()
                        val vy = ws.right.toString()
                        val p = vx + " and " + vy
                        println(p)
                    }


use "Package Names Viewer" app to get all apk's enter name and activity
