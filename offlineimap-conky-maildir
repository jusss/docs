offlineimap doesn't support mbox, only support maildir
conky support maildir, but the directory must be expanse to INBOX,
it means like ${mails $MAIL/INBOX}  
there's /var/spool/mail/john/INBOX/new tmp cur

${new_mails $MAIL/INBOX} will only check INBOX/new, that's only unseen mails
but ${mails $MAIL/INBOX} will check INBOX/cur, that's all mails
there're also seen_mails and trashed_mail, man conky you'll see more details
and also mail_spool is no longer a valid configuration setting

$MAIL can set in /etc/profile
also $MAILCHECK is default 60

use `mutt -f $MAIL/INBOX` to check mailbox
or `mail -f $MAIL/INBOX`  or just `MAIL=$MAIL/INBOX`

set $MAIL to .../INBOX

also use msmtp for sending mail
