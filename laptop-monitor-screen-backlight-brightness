or use xrandr --output your-screen --brightness 0.5  
[jusss@arch ~]$ cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness 
3905
[jusss@arch ~]$  cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness 
4882
用root编辑/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness可调整屏幕亮度
或者用 xbacklight -set 50
xbacklight是xorg-xbacklight包里面的

To set brightness to 50% of maximum:
$ xbacklight -set 50

xbacklight only works with intel. Radeon does not support the RandR backlight property.
xbacklight currently does not work with the modesetting driver 

Switching off the backlight (for example when one locks the notebook) can be useful to conserve battery 
energy. Ideally the following command inside of a graphical session should work:
$sleep 1 && xset dpms force off
