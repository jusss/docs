emacs works on mintty is well, but sometimes mintty crushes
if run the emacs from msys2 package on windows terminal or other terminals,
they won't capture some key bindings, like C-, C-; and C-h,
those keys won't send to emacs, they're captured by terminals

the solution is autohotkey

~/.emacs
(global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") 'ido-switch-buffer)
(global-set-key (kbd "<f9>") 'set-mark-command)
(global-set-key (kbd "<f8>") 'pop-to-mark-command) ;;; there's also pop-global-mark


edit emacs.ahk, then double click on it to run
LControl & ,::Send {F12}
LControl & `;::Send {F9}
LControl & '::Send {F8}

also, there's stunnel and kcptun for windows

if you want to run bash from msys2 on windows terminal,
then edit windows terminal's settings.json
{ 
 "guid":"{0caa0dad-35be-5f56-a8ff-afceeeaa6101}",
 "name":"msys2",
 "commandline":"D:\\msys32\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe -i -l",
 "hidden":false
}
