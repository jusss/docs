https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Core_dump

To generate a core dump of an arbitrary process, first install the gdb package. Then find the PID of the running process, for example with pgrep:

$ pgrep -f firefox
2071 firefox
Attach to the process:

$ gdb -p 2071
Then at the (gdb) prompt:

(gdb) generate-core-file
Saved corefile core.2071
(gdb) quit
Now you have a coredump file called core.2071.
