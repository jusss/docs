ACPI充电时，电池充满点，会显示Battery 0:	Discharging, 100%, discharging at zero rate - will never fully	discharge.

<jusss> anyone know why this happen?

<jusss> Khorne: now I plug power line into my laptop, but acpi show Battery 0:
	Discharging, 100%, discharging at zero rate - will never fully
	discharge.  [22:59]
<Khorne> And?

<jusss> and it should show charging I think

<Khorne> Charging to what? 101%?

<Khorne> Is it charging at zero rate? Discharging at zero rate? is that
	 actually the same thing?

<jusss> Khorne: I don't know, is it same?  [23:02]

<Khorne> If you are moving at 0km/h, are you moving forwards or backwards?
<Khorne> Or both?

<jusss> Khorne: so it's not important about acpi error ? 

<jusss> I can ignore that?
<Khorne> jusss, I dont think its related, acpi just interprets the
	 trickle-charge I think  [23:05]
<Khorne> And the ACPI errors are pretty common, I have them too, they are just
	 annoying, dont affect my charging or discharging

<jusss> Khorne: oh I see, it's a new way to descript about charing when it's
	100%

<Khorne> jusss, fairly certain, yea, its gonna discharge a tiny bit and then
	 gets topped off again, and discharges a tiny bit:
