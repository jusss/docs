*adduser*

The adduser defaults file is /etc/adduser.conf. The default shell defined
by the DSHELL variable is /bin/bash by default.

*useradd*

Most likely you don't need this because useradd is a very low-level
utility, and it's hardly ever used directly.

If you use useradd, edit the /etc/default/useradd skeleton file (don't
forget to make a backup though).

Set the SHELL variable to /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh.

Now every time you use useradd to add a new user bash is automatically
their default shell.

*Already existing users*

If you want to change the shell of already existing users you have to edit
the /etc/passwd file (please make sure to back have a backup of it).

Here is a description of the columns

   1. login name
   2. optional encrypted password
   3. numerical user ID
   4. numerical group ID
   5. user name or comment field
   6. user home directory
   7. optional user command interpreter

In that order separated by colons (:) like this.

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

For more information about that file consult the man page man 5 passwd.


As Octavian pointed out, the way to change the defaults depends on the way
you're creating the user. I tried creating a new user through my Gnome
Settings just now, and it seems to follow /etc/default/useradd, so that
might be your best bet. For existing users, the safest way to change
someone else's login shell is with *usermod*:

usermod -s /bin/bash $USERNAME

If you're not root, you'll need to *sudo* that. An alternative is to
*sudo* into
the user you want to modify and just run *chsh*, like this:

sudo -u $USERNAME chsh -s /bin/bash

It's best to avoid editing /etc/passwd by hand, because a mistake in there
could break all sorts of things.
