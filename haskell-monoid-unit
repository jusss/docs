the unit in >>= is "return", and return can pick value constructor from the context and combine one
id is the unit in the monoid (.), so
a `op` unit = a  
unit `op` a = a

return is the unit in >>=
id is the unit in (.)

0 is the unit in +
1 is the unit in *

0 + 1 == 1
1 * 3 == 3

Nothing is the unit in Control.Applicative.<|>

Nothing <|> Just 3 == Just 3

<|> is `mplus` in monoid

foldl1 (<|>) [Nothing, Nothing, Just 3] == Just 3

isNothing $ foldl1 (<|>) [Nothing, Nothing, Nothing] == True
