it's been two years that archlinux on my eeepc don't upgrade, and I'd like to upgrade to now
#pacman-key --refresh-keys 
if it takes so long time, then use
#pacman -S archlinux-keyring
then
#pacman -Syu

if it missing some file that make you can't login bash, make a live cd then copy the file into it
or use live cd mount the disk then pacman -r /mnt -Syu, maybe you need change /etc/pacman.conf
