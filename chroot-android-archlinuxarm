download archlinuxarm-armv7h-latest.tar.gz from archlinuxarm.org
dd if=/dev/zero of=arch.img bs=512K count=8000
mount -o loop arch.img /tmp/myloop
decompress archlinuxarm-armv7h-latest.tar.gz into /tmp/myloop
you can use `jmtpfs ~/empty-mount` to mount android storage device on linux
on Android, install busybox, connectbot, flash android with supersu in recovery mode for root, 
open connectbot, run `su`, and copy arch.img to sdcard, in android 4.4.4 it should in /storage/sdcard1
cd /storage/sdcard1
/system/xbin/mount -o loop /storage/sdcard1/arch.img /storage/sdcard1/ar
cd ar
mount -o bind /dev ./dev
mount -t proc /proc ./proc
mount -t sysfs /sys ./sys
mount -t devpts /dev/pts ./dev/pts
chroot . /bin/bash
su
cd
vi /etc/group
inet:x:3003:root
net_raw:x:3004:root

touch /etc/resolv.conf add nameserver 223.5.5.5
touch resolv.conf and failed, ls -lh /etc/resolv.conf and you will know it's softlink
it point /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
then creat that file or just delete this link and recreate a really file

creat the file will work

vim /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist  add ustc source
pacman -Sy
pacman -S aria2
pacman -S xterm
install xrdb on android and open it, it remind :0
then xterm -display :0 will show xterm in xrdb

pacman -S lxde
env DISPLAY=:0 startlxde


share file or msg
mkdir share directory at the same level with ar
mkdir /storage/sdcard1/share
/system/xbin/mount -o bind share ar/mnt
then in chroot environment, you can get outside file just pass it to share directory

on Android, install gedit for edit file, browse rarbg.com for magnet link
copy magnet link from rarbg.com to /storage/sdcard1/share/magnet, 
aria2c -i /mnt/magnet
just download file in /mnt of chroot env, you can get file directly from outside of chroot env
even aria2 download file not store in the share directory /mnt, just mv them into /mnt will be ok, you still can get those files from outside of chroot env
if you mount android into linux with jmtpfs and there's nothing on /storage/sdcard1/share, you should copy it into another non-share directory on android, then mount
it on linux will show those files
