
compose  like
input   f          g   output
•        ------ ------  •
g (f x)

wrapped like f is inside g
g x
monad compose like
x  Maybe  IO
.  --      --

monad compose would be like
reader_bind( maybe_bind(x, f), g )
monad compose would change the monad context 

function do compose, monad do not
g take f's output as input, that's compose
monad do not, since monad compose would 
like chain different monads, that can not
monad can be wrapped by another monad

compose is (g . f) x
wrapped is ContT r m a
