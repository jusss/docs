snd_pcm_oss module provides the /dev/dsp and /dev/sound/dsp stuff.

make the user have right to access /dev/snd/ files, even in chroot environment

<jusss> ls -l /dev/snd , and got crw-rw----+ 1 root   92 116,  2 Jan 12 12:52
	controlC0, what is 92 116?
<grawity> you realize that's not actually in the manpage
<grawity> either way, for chardevs & blockdevs, those are the device's
	  major/minor number
<jusss> grawity: and the '+' means ? 
<grawity> it's got ACLs
<grawity> `info ls verbose` describes most of it
<grawity> actually no â€“ 92 is the group ID, 116 is the device major, 2 is the
	  device minor
<grawity> (group 92 is 'audio' on non-broken arch systems)
<jusss> grawity: I use user 'jusss' chroot into a environment, and I can play
	music, but I use user 'john' chroot into it, and it said 'libGL error:
	failed to open drm device: Permission denied, libGL error: failed to
	load driver: 3'   do you know why? john and jusss are both regular
	user of host system
<grawity> access to these devices is granted based on what user logged in to
	  the host system
<grawity> if you logged in to the host system as 'juss' (UID 1000), then the
	  audio device has ACLs allowing it to be used by the same 'juss' only


libGL error: failed to open drm device: Permission denied

I can already tell your problem is that the login hasn't set correct permissions on /dev/dri/*. This is normal (not a bug) for tty logins, but should be resolved automatically with graphical logins (lightdm).

groupmod -g new-gid group-name

91 is audio, 92 is video

/etc/group  group id
/etc/passwd  user id
/etc/shadow  user password

sudo groupmod -g 91 video
sudo groupmod -g 92 audio
or directly change /etc/group

sound card, ls -l /dev/snd   root 92
video card, ls -l /dev/dri   root 91

useradd, passwd, usermod, finger, w, who, id, 
gpasswd, groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, groups


in chroot, john uid is 1000, in host system jusss id is 1000
and they gid also are same 1000
so john touch files, it will be jusss's
because they have same user id and same group id
so change john's id with usermod and groupmod

man usermod, uid range is 1000 to 60000, 
groupmod -g 60000 john
usermod -u 60000 -g 60000 john

now, chroot user john is uid 60000 and gid 60000
john can't change anything in /bla2
because /bla2 is owned by uid 1000 gid 1000, rw-r--r--

in chroot, groupadd -g 1000 host_group
gpasswd -a john host_group

in host, chmod 770 /bla2
chmod -R 770 /bl2

or chmod -R 740 /bla2,  user in chroot can read /bla2 but can't write /bla2

maybe set /bla2  sgid and sbit will be better than this for sharing one partition
