since android 10, lineageos 17.1 won't release su 
but it can get root with adb

enable 'rooted debugging' in developer options
run `adb root` then `adb shell` u will get root privilege

before 17.1, you can get su file via https://download.lineageos.org/extras
and just flash it via recovery, then in adb shell run `su`

adb root
adb remount # to remount /system as read-write, not readonly
nano /system/usr/keylayout/Generic.kl
change 125 to WINDOW

125 META_LEFT is window/super key in the physical keyboard
