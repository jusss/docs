singleton object activity keep unique
startActivity won't destory activity, this.finish will
update ProgressBar inside IO, so the activity contain ProgressBar
shouldn't be destoried, 

manifest, activity lanuchmode singletask to make class activity keep alive!

keep UI and IO split, then refresh UI per second and read data from IO
IO store msg into a static class/companion object, UI read it
so if UI is destoryed, it won't affect IO
if you update UI inside IO, then if UI is destoryed, IO is destoryed too

stream is IO,
channel is NIO, New IO

UI adapter use companion object as dataSource, IO change companion object, not pass through activity
this could keep IO data alive!
