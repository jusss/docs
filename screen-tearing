after 2013, intel xorg driver has some bugs,
suggest use `uxa` instead of `sna`
and there're still some screen tearing bugs
even chromium and firefox have this screen tearing issue when 
browse websites and watch videos on websites

now, change `Identifier` in `Device` section in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf

before

Section "Device"
        Option     "AccelMethod"        "uxa"	
        Option     "SwapbuffersWait"    "true"
        Option     "TearFree"           "true"	
	Identifier  "Card0"
	Driver      "intel"
	BusID       "PCI:0:2:0"
EndSection

after

Section "Device"
        Option     "AccelMethod"        "sna"	
        Option     "DRI"               "3" 	
        Option     "SwapbuffersWait"    "true"
        Option     "TearFree"           "true"	
	Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
	Driver      "intel"
	BusID       "PCI:0:2:0"
