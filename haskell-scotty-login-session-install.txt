git clone https://github.com/asg0451/scotty-login-session.git
cd scotty-login-session
cabal v2-build
there're 3 steps need to change the lib, and follow it
two are to add ghc feature to the two files
the third is add MonadUnliftIO m to the type constraint of runSql' and runDB'
and import Control.Monad.IO.Unlift

vim scotty-login-session.cabal, in build-depends add 'unliftio-core'
then cabal v2-build will be done

cabal repl 
import Web.Scotty.Login.Session will be ok

cabal v2-install --lib

ghc examples/Simple.hs -package scotty 

ghc -package scotty -optl-static your-code.hs to binary and pass it to the vps, run it

another way is cabal v2-install those needed file to somewhere,
then run dpkg-deb --build BuildPackage to generate deb package to install it on vps

and third way is using swapon file to extend the memory of vps, and compile it on vps

#!/bin/bash
umask 066; dd bs=1M count=4096 if=/dev/zero of=/myswap; mkswap /myswap;
swapon /myswap
