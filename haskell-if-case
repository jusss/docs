1. if and case
val :: Maybe (Either SomeException ())
if val == Nothing then ... won't work
case val of Nothing -> is ok

because == on values of type Maybe a requires that the underlying type a is also comparable
which is likely not the case for SomeException

otherway, you can use Data.Maybe.maybe or fromMaybe to disassemble it
