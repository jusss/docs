Redmi Note 7 Lineage OS 18.1 Android 11
Cube i6 Air Windows 10 32bit
scrcpy win32 v1.17

1. use otg connect android to windows tablet
2. developer options, enable Force Desktop mode, Force activies to be resizable, Enable freeform windows and Enable freeform siecompat
3. there're two ways to set second display's resolution
        one is use developer options's Simulate secondary displays
        another is `adb shell settings put global overlay_display_devices 2048x1536/300` 
4. right click on scrcpy.exe -> Properties -> Compatibility -> Change high DPI settings ->
    Override high DPI scaling behavior -> Scaling performed by Application
    this will solve fuzzy fonts and blur icons show on windows 10, this should improve VNC image quality
5. on windows 10, run `scrcpy.exe --display 1 --window-borderless -f -Sw`, if display 1 is not available, it may be 2 or 3, check the error message
6. `adb shell settings put global overlay_display_devices none` , close it

'cause connected by usb type-c cable, so no need for adb over wifi, just run scrcpy will be ok
before that, remember run `adb shell` to check if it's connected, if not, then choose MTP as usb connection option

if you want use adb over wifi on android 11, then 
1. in developer options, enable Wireless debugging, and click into, click Pair device with pairing code
2. run `adb pair android-ip:port`  using that pop up ip-port and code on android, input pair code, 
3. after pair sucessful, run `adb connect ip:port` that shows in Wireless debugging page
4. then run `scrcpy`

2048x1536 is tablet's resolution, change it to your screen's resolution, and 300 is density, like scale, if fonts and icons too big or small, change it

windows 32bit, scrcpy can't use --render-driver opengl, it cause a blank screen, as default it uses direct3d
