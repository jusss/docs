install outline on server:
sudo wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-server/master/src/server_manager/install_scripts/install_server.sh | bash
this will output a dict like {"apiUrl":..., "sha256":} and it will be stored in ~/shadowbox/access.txt

systemctl stop docker
and run that `sudo wget -q0- https:...` again will creat a new outline server


then download Outline-Manager.AppImage not Outline-Client.AppImage from github on client:
install shadowsocks-qt5
then run it on client, click "get started"
copy the dict message from server into it,
click "add key" then click the key and share it, pull down the share page you'll find
the ss key address, and copy it to others, maybe when they use it they need cross gfw at first.
