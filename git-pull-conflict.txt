before you push you code to repo
you may want to do `git pull` first
but git pull may conflict, if the same file on repo were changed after you latest pull
so get the conflict files

then git diff those file, get those files how you changed, then git restore those file,
then change them again

for example scripts/a.py is conflicted
git diff scripts/a.py > diff.txt
git checkout -- scripts/a.py
git pull
then change scripts/a.py again
vim diff.txt scripts/a.py
:vsplit
git add, commit, push

no -or + are the same part
only + is the add part
+ follow - is the changed part
