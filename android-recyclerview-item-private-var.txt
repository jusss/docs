android recyclerview all inside adapter are reused
there's no private variable in adapter

for example, define var uploadCount = 0L inside ViewHolder class

when data source is less than 5, it means items less than 5,
every item has its own uploadCount, change item 1's uploadCount won't affect others,
but when there're 6 items, item 6 and item 1 share the one same uploadCount,
change item 1 means change item 6

so only way is define uploadCount in the data source
